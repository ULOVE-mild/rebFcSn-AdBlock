# rebFcSn-AdBlock

This repository is for the resources of [Block Crypto Shortner & Faucet (bCsF)](https://github.com/bCsF-national). It receives all reports for new filters or existing filters that cause web page breakage. Any contributors are welcome. Contributors who are proven valuable will get write permissions to the repository.

The rationale for including a specific filter in bCsF'n filter lists is the same as the Easylist and also takes into account whether a filter requires bCsF'n extended filter syntax.

It is preferred to fix filter issues in EasyList. Any filters included in bCsF'n filter lists must use the [extended syntax](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Static-filter-syntax#extended-syntax).

The EasyList-compatible fixes for high-traffic websites are added to bCsF'n filters until they become added to EasyList.

uAssets will fix the following exceptions even if they do not require using the extended syntax:

- Ad-Reinsertion
- Anti-Blocker
- Context Menu Blockage
- Cut/Copy/Paste Blockage
- Popups/Popunders
- Website Breakage
- Video Ads
- Faucet site
- Shortner
